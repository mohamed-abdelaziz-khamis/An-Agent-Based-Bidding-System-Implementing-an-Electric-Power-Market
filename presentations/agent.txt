We think that the agent abstraction can be a powerful paradigm for 
addressing these issues. It decomposes the complexity of problems into 
small autonomous communicating entities, the agents, well suited for 
computationally constrained environments. 

AgentCities is a promising initiative, which tries to realise the 
commercial and research potential of FIPA agent applications. 
It aims to build a network of publicly accessible, continually 
available FIPA platforms, where each platform represents a real 
world city or place (Lausanne, Paris, etc). Services deployed in 
AgentCities centre on information and transaction services for real 
world objects such as shops, restaurants, hotels, cinemas, theatres 
etc.
