      <P><FONT face=Arial size=3>The study of multiagent systems <A 
      name=mas></A>(MAS) focuses on systems in which many intelligent agents 
      interact with each other. The agents are considered to be autonomous 
      entities, such as software programs or robots. Their interactions can be 
      either cooperative or selfish. That is, the agents can share a common goal 
      (e.g. an ant colony), or they can pursue their own interests (as in the 
      free market economy). </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=3>MAS researchers develop communications 
      languages, interaction protocols, and agent architectures that facilitate 
      the development of multiagent systems. For example, a MAS researcher can 
      tell you how to program each ant in a colony in order to get them all to 
      bring food to the nest in the most efficient manner, or how to set up 
      rules so that a group of selfish agents will work together to accomplish a 
      given task. MAS researchers draw on ideas from many disciplines outside of 
      AI, including biology, sociology, economics, organization and management 
      science, complex systems, and philosophy.</FONT></P>

      Perspective</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. By Peter Stone and Manuela Veloso, 
      Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University. "Distributed 
      Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less 
      than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple 
      independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has 
      been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) 
      focusses on the information management aspects of systems with several 
      branches working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) 
      deals with behavior management in collections of several independent 
      entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an 
      introduction to the field and as an organizational 
      framework."</FONT></FONT></P>

        Systems</A>: "The most important reason to use MAS when designing a 
        system is that some domains require it. In particular, if there are 
        different people or organizations with different (possibly conflicting) 
        goals and proprietary information, then a multiagent system is needed to 
        handle their interactions. Even if each organization wants to model its 
        internal affairs with a single system, the organizations will not give 
        authority to any single person to build a system that represents them 
        all: the different organizations will need their own systems that 
        reflect their capabilities and priorities." </FONT>

      Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems. "Gourps, 
      organizations, and societies are inherently computational and 
      computational multi-agent systems are inherently organizational. Thus, 
      within CASOS we attempt to understand and formally model two distinct but 
      complimentary types of phenomena. The first is the natural or human group, 
      organizational or society, which is universally informatted and 
      continually acquires, manipulates, and produces information (and possibly 
      other material goods) through the joint, and interlocked activities of 
      people and automated information technologies. The second is the 
      artificial computational systems which is generally comprised of multiple 
      distributed agents who can mutually influence, constrain and suppurt each 
      other as they try to manage and manipulate the knowledge, communication 
      and interaction networks in which they are embedded. Computational 
      analysis is used to develop a better understanding of the fundamental 
      priciples of organizing, coordinating, and managing multiple information 
      processing agents (whether they are human, WebBot, or robots) and the 
      fundamental dynamic nature of groups, organizations and societies." - from
