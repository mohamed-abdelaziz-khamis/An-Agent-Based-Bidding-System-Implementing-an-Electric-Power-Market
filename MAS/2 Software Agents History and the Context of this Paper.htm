<H2>2 Software Agents: History and the Context of this Paper</H2>
<P>Software agents have evolved from multi-agent systems (MAS), which in turn 
form one of three broad areas which fall under DAI, the other two being 
Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Parallel AI (PAI). Hence, as with 
multi-agent systems, they inherit many of DAIís motivations, goals and potential 
benefits. For example, thanks to distributed computing, software agents inherit 
DAIís potential benefits including modularity, speed (due to parallelism) and 
reliability (due to redundancy). It also inherits those due to AI such as 
operation at the knowledge level, easier maintenance, reusability and platform 
independence (Huhns &amp; Singh, 1994). 
<P>The concept of an agent, in the context of this paper, can be traced back to 
the early days of research into DAI in the 1970s - indeed, to Carl Hewittís 
concurrent Actor model (Hewitt, 1977). In this model, Hewitt proposed the 
concept of a self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object which 
he termed ëactorí. This object had some encapsulated internal state and could 
respond to messages from other similar objects: an actor 
<P><FONT size=2>"is a computational agent which has a mail address and a 
behaviour. Actors communicate by message-passing and carry out their actions 
concurrently" (Hewitt, 1977, p. 131).</FONT> 
<P>Broadly, for the purposes of this paper, we split the research on agents into 
two main strands: the first spanning the period 1977 to the current day, and the 
second from 1990 to the current day too. Strand 1 work on smart agents, which 
begun in the late 1970s and all through the 1980s to the current day, 
concentrated mainly on deliberative-type agents with symbolic internal models; 
later in this paper, we type these as collaborative agents. A deliberative agent 
is 
<P><FONT size=2>"one that possesses an explicitly represented, symbolic model of 
the world, and in which decisions (for example about what actions to perform) 
are made via symbolic reasoning" (Wooldridge, 1995, p. 42). </FONT>
<P>Initially, strand 1 work concentrated on <I>macro</I> issues such as the 
interaction and communication between agents, the decomposition and distribution 
of tasks, coordination and cooperation, conflict resolution via negotiation, 
etc. Their goal was to specify, analyse, design and integrate systems comprising 
of multiple collaborative agents. These resulted in classic systems and work 
such as the actor model (Hewitt, 1977), MACE (Gasser<I> et al</I>., 1987), DVMT 
(Lesser &amp; Corkill, 1981), MICE (Durfee &amp; Montgomery, 1989), MCS (Doran 
<I>et al</I>., 1990), the contract network coordination approach (Smith, 1980; 
Davis &amp; Smith, 1983), MAS/DAI planning and game theories (Rosenschein, 1985; 
Zlotkin &amp; Rosenschein, 1989; Rosenschein &amp; Zlotkin, 1994). These ëmacroí 
aspects of agents as Gasser (1991) terms them, emphasises the <I>society</I> of 
agents over <I>individual</I> agents, while <I>micro</I> issues relate 
specifically to the latter. In any case, such issues are well summarised in 
Chaib-draa <I>et al.</I> (1992), Bond &amp; Gasser (1988) and Gasser &amp; Huhns 
(1989). More recent work under this strand include TÆMS (Decker &amp; Lesser, 
1993; Decker, 1995) DRESUN (Carver <I>et al</I>., 1991; Carver &amp; Lesser, 
1995), VDT (Levitt <I>et al</I>., 1994), ARCHON (Wittig, 1992; Jennings <I>et 
al</I>., 1995); Note that game theoretic work should arguably <I>not</I> be 
classed as a macro approach; it may, indeed, lie more towards the micro end of 
the spectrum. 
<P>In addition to the macro issues, strand 1 work has also been characterised by 
research and development into theoretical, architectural and language issues. In 
fact, such works evolve naturally, though not exclusively, from the 
investigation of the macro issues. This is well summarised in Wooldridge &amp; 
Jennings (1995a), and in the edited collections of papers: Wooldridge &amp; 
Jennings (1995b) and Wooldridge <I>et al.</I> (1996). 
<P>However, since 1990 or thereabouts, there has evidently been another distinct 
strand to the research and development work on software agents - <I>the range of 
agent types being investigated is now much broader</I>. Thus, this paper is 
complementary to Wooldridge &amp; Jenningsí (1995a) by placing emphasis on this 
strand although, naturally, there is some overlap, i.e. it overviews the 
broadening typology of agents being investigated by agent researchers. Some 
cynics may argue that this strand arises because everybody is now calling 
everything an agent, thereby resulting, inevitably, in such broadness. We 
sympathise with this viewpoint; indeed, it is a key motivation for this paper - 
to overview the extensive work that goes under the ëagentí banner. Essentially, 
our point is that in addition to investigating macro issues and others such as 
theories, architectures, languages, there has also been an unmistakable trend 
towards the investigation of a broader range of agent types or classes. The 
context of this paper is summarised in Table 1 below.<BR>
