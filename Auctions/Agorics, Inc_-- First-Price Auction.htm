      <H2 align=center>Auctions -- First-Price, Sealed Bid (Discriminatory) 
</H2>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>The third auction 
      type considered here has a primary characteristic of being sealed (not 
      open-outcry like the English or Dutch varieties) and thus hidden from 
      other bidders. A winning bidder pays exactly the amount he bid. Usually, 
      (but not always) each participant is allowed one bid which means that bid 
      preparation is especially important. To confuse matters the financial 
      community refers to this type of auction as an English auction (except in 
      Great Britain where it is known as the American auction!). In these 
      articles we will use the academic name rather than that used in financial 
      circles. 
      <P>Speaking generally, a sealed-bid format has two distinct parts--a 
      bidding period in which participants submit their bids, and a resolution 
      phase in which the bids are opened and the winner determined (sometimes 
      the winner is not announced). </P>
      <P>An important distinction must be made as to quantity--how many goods 
      are being auctioned--one or multiple items. The name <A 
      name=terms.html#first></A>"first-price" comes from the fact that the award 
      is made at the highest offer when a single unit is sold. When multiple 
      units are being auctioned, it is called <A 
      name=terms.html#discriminatory></A>"discriminatory" because not all 
      winning bidders pay the same amount. </P>
      <P>It works like this: In a first-price auction (one unit up for sale) 
      each bidder submits one bid in ignorance of all other bids. The highest 
      bidder wins and pays the amount he bid. In a "discriminatory (more than 
      one unit for sale) auction", sealed bids are sorted from high to low, and 
      items awarded at highest bid price until the supply is exhausted. The most 
      important point to remember is that winning bidders can (and usually do) 
      pay different prices. </P>
      <P>From a bidder's point of view, a high bid raises the probability of 
      winning but lowers the profit if the bidder is victorious. A good strategy 
      is to shade a bid downward closer to market consensus, a strategy that 
      also helps to avoid <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#winnerc">winner's 
      curse.</A> </P>
      <P>This type of auction is used for refinancing credit and foreign 
      exchange. Up until 1993, the U.S. Treasury used the discriminatory auction 
      to sell off its debt, but this method is not without its detractors. In 
      the case of U.S. Treasury securities, Milton Friedman warned early on that 
      the discriminatory auction was susceptible to collusion. An investor is 
      reluctant to expose his valuation to the Treasury because the stated 
      intention of the Treasury is to gain the highest price possible. It is 
      advantageous to a bidder to gather information about a competitor's 
      valuation before the auction. Milton Friedman proved to be prophetic. The 
      U.S. Treasury securities auction will be discussed later in greater 
      detail. </P>
