      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>The 
      descending-price auction, commonly known in academic literature as the 
      Dutch auction, uses an open format rather than a sealed-bid method. It is 
      the technique used in Netherlands to auction produce and flowers (hence, a 
      "Dutch" auction). Unfortunately, the financial world has chosen to refer 
      to another type of auction as the Dutch auction. In the financial world, 
      the auction known as "Dutch" is what is referred to in the academic world 
      as a uniform, second-price auction. Great confusion results. In this 
      series of articles, the "Dutch" auction will mean a descending-bid 
      structure. 
      <P>In a Dutch auction, bidding starts at an extremely high price and is 
      progressively lowered until a buyer claims an item by calling "mine", or 
      by pressing a button that stops an automatic clock. When multiple units 
      are auctioned, normally more takers press the button as price declines. In 
      other words, the first winner takes his prize and pays his price and later 
      winners pay less. When the goods are exhausted, the bidding is over. </P>
      <P>Dutch auctions have been used to finance credit in Rumania and for 
      foreign exchange in Bolivia, Jamaica, Zambia and have also been used to 
      sell fish in England and in Israel. <BR><BR>Dutch auctions are common in 
      less obvious forms. Filene's, a large store in Boston, keeps in its 
      basement a variety of marked-down goods, each with a price and date 
      attached. The price paid at the register is the price on the tag minus a 
      discount that depends upon how long ago the item was tagged. As time 
      passes and the item remains unsold, the discount rises from 10 to as high 
      as 70 percent. <BR><BR>It is believed that the English system may be 
      inferior to Dutch in one area. The key to any successful auction (from the 
      seller's point of view) is the effect of competition on the potential 
      buyers, and in an English auction, the underbidder usually forces the bid 
      up by one small step. The winner may end up paying well under his 
      valuation and thus the seller does not receive the maximum price. 
      <BR><BR>However, in the Dutch system, if the bidder with the highest 
      interest really wants an item, he cannot afford to wait too long to enter 
      his bid. That means he might bid at or near his highest <A
