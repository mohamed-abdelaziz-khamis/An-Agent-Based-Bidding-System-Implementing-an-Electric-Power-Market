      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>The truth is that 
      the entire subject of auction strategy is numbingly complex with numerous 
      variables coming into play. Is a bidder <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#riskav">risk-averse</A> 
      or <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#riskne">risk-neutral</A>? 
      Is the auction for one item or multiple units? Do you plan to resell the 
      acquired object or use it yourself? If you plan to resell it, are the 
      other bidders symmetric? That is, do they use the same measurements to 
      estimate their valuations? Do you have secret information about the 
      object? Might others have secret information? <BR><BR>All of these factors 
      play a part in auction strategy, and so this section can only provide an 
      overview with a few assorted general ideas. Those readers wishing to know 
      more are invited to read the bibliography which contains excellent 
      references, and those references in turn point to other more technical 
      papers. <BR><BR>It is safe to make a few general remarks. <BR><BR>Buyers 
      really do bid differently depending upon the rules of an auction, and it 
      is worth understanding the rules of an auction thoroughly. In fact, the 
      one piece of information available to all is the rules. <BR><BR>Economists 
      use a framework called game theory to think about auction behavior. Using 
      game theory economists examine rational behavior and decisions made in 
      varying conditions. <BR><BR>A seller, on the one hand, is faced with 
      choosing an auction type, and so he must predict the behavior of bidders. 
      On the other hand, a bidder tries to predict the behavior of the other 
      bidders. Each bidder makes an estimate of his own value of the object and 
      also an estimate of what others will bid on it. Good bidding is often the 
      result of correct predictions about the behavior of others and sometimes 
      that means guessing the extent of someone else's information correctly. 
      [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Mester">Mester</A>] 

      <P>Economists try to devise sets of rules to determine dominant strategies 
      under a huge array of variables. Bidders, of course, tend to worry more 
      about their bids than their strategy.</P>
      <H3>From a Seller's Perspective </H3>In any auction a seller can influence 
      results by revealing information about the object. Intuitively, a bidder's 
      profits rise when he can exploit information asymmetries (when the bidder 
      has information not available to others). In general, the more information 
      a bidder has, the more the price-dampening effect of <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#winnerc">winner's 
      curse</A> is lessened. So a seller's optimal strategy is to reveal 
      information and to link the final price to outside indicators of value (an 
      authoritative evaluation). It is also a good idea because if a seller 
      seems reluctant to disclose something, a buyer always assumes the hidden 
      information must be unfavorable. <BR><BR><IMG height=112 alt=Sidebar 
      src="Agorics, Inc_-- Auction Strategies_files/auct8quo.gif" width=192 
      align=right>Revealing information removes uncertainty. <BR><BR>Theoretical 
      literature demonstrates that, under assumption of <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#private-value">private 
      value,</A> all four basic auction types can be shown to yield the same 
      expected price and revenue to the seller when bidders are risk neutral and 
      symmetric. This implies that auction choice is not crucial because each 
      format yields on average the same payoff. <BR><BR>But revenue equivalence 
      does not hold true under <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#common-value">common 
      value</A> assumption (when bidders have similar evaluations). It has been 
      shown that the four auction types can be ranked from highest to lowest as 
      follows: English ascending-price; the second-price, sealed bid auction; 
      Dutch (descending) auctions and first-price, sealed bid auctions tied. The 
      rankings illustrate advantages of increased information. Remember that an 
      English auction reveals information about rival bidder <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#value">valuations</A> 
      and permits dynamic updating of personal valuation (which leads to more 
      aggressive bidding). In comparison, bidders, recognizing winner's curse, 
      bidding in first-price auctions bid less aggressively and shade their 
      bids. Similar reasoning applies to Dutch (descending) auctions. In 
      contrast, in second-price sealed-bid format, the winner pays the bid of 
      the next highest so bidders raise bids, secure that they will not be 
      disadvantaged if rival bids are lower. <BR><BR>In Dutch and first-price 
      auctions, bidders behave in the same way, and so, it does not matter which 
      of these auctions a seller chooses nor does it matter whether the bidders 
      have private values or common values. The reason that a bidder behaves the 
      same in both kinds of auction is that he makes the same decision and this 
      decision is based upon the same information. In both auctions a bidder 
      knows that if he wins he must pay exactly what he bid. He knows also that 
      he only wins if his bid is higher than that of everyone else. He must also 
      decide upon his bid without knowing what others will do. <BR><BR>There is 
      disagreement over this. Paul Milgrom [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Milgrom-3">Milgrom 
      (3)</A>] argues that in general an English auction generates more money in 
      more environments than the Dutch or sealed bid auction types (on average), 
      and this probably helps explain its popularity. <BR><BR>In the case of 
      choosing between a second-price and an English auction, however, the 
      decision must be based upon whether bidders know their private valuations 
      or whether they are uncertain about the single common value of the item 
      for sale. In an auction wherein bidders have independent private values, 
      the auctions both yield the same. <BR><BR>However, in a common value 
      auction the English and second-price auctions do not yield the same 
      revenue. Remember that in an English auction a bidder can gain useful 
      information by observing other bidders. He can watch to see how many 
      bidders drop out of the auction (they value the object less) and he can 
      see also exactly when they dropped out (how high was their last bid?). If 
      lots of bidders remain in an auction this gives a bidder confidence that a 
      high valuation was correct, and so he tends to bid higher.

      </P>
      <P>But the risk characteristics of a bidder are important too. A bidder 
      who is risk averse (meaning he absolutely requires the item being 
      auctioned) tends to bid higher so that he will have a greater chance of 
      victory. A risk neutral bidder does not. </P><BR><BR>In the independent 
      value behavior when all bidders are risk neutral, a seller receives the 
      same revenue from both the English and second-price auction. 
      <BR><BR>However, if the bidders are risk averse, then the first-price (and 
      also the Dutch) yields greater revenue than English and second-price 
      auctions. <BR><BR>

      <H3>From a Bidder's Perspective </H3></CENTER>Theoretical literature 
      assumes that auction participants are homogeneous (risk neutral and 
      symmetric--they use the same distribution function to estimate 
      valuations). It assumes bidders all focus on maximizing profits and that 
      only one item is being auctioned. <BR><BR>Paul Milgrom [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Milgrom-1">Milgrom 
      (1)</A>] describes a strategy for contract bidding. "To make money in 
      competitive bidding, you will need to mark up your bids twice: once to 
      correct for the underestimation of costs on the projects you win and a 
      second time to include a margin for profit. Don't let the presence of 
      several competing bidders push you into making too aggressive a bid. The 
      markup to adjust for underestimation will have to be larger the larger the 
      number of your competitors and the more you respect the accuracy of their 
      cost estimation; you may, however, want to make the profit markup smaller 
      when there are more competitors." <BR><BR>Students point out that you 
      can't make money if you are too cautious. Milgrom [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Milgrom-1">Milgrom 
      (1)</A>] says in response, "The most important lessons to be learned from 
      both the theory and the experiments are that the returns in bidding come 
      from cost and information advantages, that naive bidding strategies can 
      squander these advantages, and that bidders without some advantage have 
      little hope of earning much profit, but could with a little bit of 
      carelessness suffer large losses." <BR><BR>What about irrationality 
      amongst bidders? What if Louise, a bidder, understands winner's curse, but 
      her opponents, Ellen and Sam do not? What should Louise do? She knows that 
      her rivals will overbid. Answer: she should scale down her bid even 
      further because winner's curse is intensified against over-optimistic 
      rivals. If Louise wins against a rival who commonly overbids, Louise has 
      probably erred in her valuation. <BR><BR>A bidder uses the same strategy 
      in both Dutch and first-price sealed auctions because the same information 
      is available in each. In a Dutch auction, a bidder considers and selects a 
      cutoff price. He will claim the object if no one has claimed it before. In 
      a sealed-bid first price, the decision is exactly the same. All bidders 
      have the same strategies for these auctions--shade bids down slightly so 
      as not to be caught by winner's curse. 
      <H3>English Strategy </H3>In a private-value English auction, a player's 
      best strategy is to bid a small amount more than the previous high bid 
      until he reaches his valuation and then stop. This is optimal because he 
      always wants to buy an object if the price is less than its value to him, 
      but he wants to pay the lowest possible price. Bidding always ends when 
      the price reaches the valuation of the player with the second-highest 
      valuation. <BR><BR>An advantage to English auctions is that a bidder gains 
      information. He can observe and see not only that other players drop out, 
      but also the price at which the competition abandons the bidding. That 
      tells a bidder a great deal about the valuations of others and allows a 
      bidder to revise his valuation on the fly. <BR><BR>A player's strategy is 
      his series of bids as a function of (1) his value, (2) his prior estimate 
      of the other players' valuations, and (3) the past bids of other players. 
      His bid can be updated as information changes. <BR><BR>If you attend an 
      auction in person, it is good to remember that auctioneers sometime 
      appreciate the first bid on an item because it helps get the auction 
      started. Sometimes they show their appreciation by giving a first bidder 
      what is called a "<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#fast">fast 
      knock</A>". From the point of view of the auctioneer, a fast knock is a 
      calculated sacrifice, something akin to a loss-leader in a department 
      store sale. <BR><BR>Another point to remember is that some people are 
      intimidated by <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#rings">rings</A>, 
      but you can always outbid a ring. Their strategy has to be based upon 
      buying an item at a low enough price to make a profit. 
      <H3>Dutch Strategy </H3>The problem for the bidder in a Dutch auction is 
      exactly the same as that facing a bidder in a sealed-bid auction. At some 
      point in advance, the bidder must decide the maximum amount he will bid. 
      He must decide when to stop the auction based upon his own valuation of 
      the object and his prior beliefs about the valuations of other bidders. 
      <BR><BR>This auction type is strategically equivalent to first-price 
      sealed auction because no relevant information is disclosed in the course 
      of the auction, only at the end when it is too late. 
      <H3>First-Price, Sealed Bid Strategy </H3>It is difficult to specify a 
      single strategy because a profit-maximizing bid depends upon the actions 
      of others. The tradeoff is between bidding high and winning more often, 
      and bidding low and benefiting more if the bid wins (bigger profit 
      margin). <BR><BR>Most bidders attempt to shade their bids to move closer 
      to market consensus. This also helps to avoid winner's curse. 
      <H3>Vickrey Strategy </H3>Paul Milgrom [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Milgrom-1">Milgrom 
      (1)</A>] suggests that the dominant strategy for a bidder in a Vickrey 
      (second-price) auction is to submit a bid equal to his true <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#reserve">reservation</A> 
      price because he then accepts all offers below his reservation bid and 
      none that are above. A participant who bids less is more likely to lose 
      the auction and all that strategy accomplishes is to lower the chance of 
      victory. Bidding high carries the risk of winner's curse. Neither affects 
      the price paid if he wins. <BR><BR>When each bidder adopts a strategy of 
      bidding his true price, the outcome is that the item is awarded to the 
      bidder with the highest valuation at a price equal to the second highest 
      valuation. The existence of a dominant strategy means that bidder can 
      determine his own sealed bid without regard for the actions of others. So 
      a second-price auction duplicates the principal characteristics of an 
      English auction. It should be noted that a second-price auction 
      participant chooses a strategy without regard for the actions of others. 
      <BR><BR>A potential drawback is that this system requires total honesty 
      from the auctioneer (s). If the auctioneer is not trustworthy, he could 
      open the bids, find the winner and insert a new bid just barely under that 
      to ensure higher revenues.
