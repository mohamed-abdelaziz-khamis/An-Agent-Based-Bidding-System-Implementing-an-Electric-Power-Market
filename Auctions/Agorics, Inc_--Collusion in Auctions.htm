      <H2>Collusion and Tricks</H2></CENTER>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>Which auction type 
      is the best? As discussed earlier, there is no single answer to that 
      question, but one way of approaching that subject is to think about 
      collusion; the extent to which incentives to collude vary under different 
      auction types can help determine which type of auction to choose. All 
      auction types are susceptible to collusion, but degrees of incentives 
      vary. <BR>
      <CENTER>
      <H3>Rings </H3></CENTER>Rings are simple to understand. A subset of 
      bidders gather together and agree not to outbid each other which has the 
      overall effect of lowering the winning bid. Later the item is re-auctioned 
      amongst ring members and the profits are shared. (This poses an 
      interesting conflict because in this instance, the ring-bidders are also 
      owners/sellers. Motivations of buyers and sellers are quite different.) In 
      essence, these buyers agree to reduce competition by not competing against 
      each other. <BR><BR>It works like this: A ring of 5 people agree to band 
      together and bid on a necklace. Frank is appointed the designated bidder, 
      and he buys the necklace for $50. After the auction, the ring members meet 
      and hold another auction at which the necklace is sold to Blanche for 
      $100. Now, from the $100, Blanche reimburses Frank for the original $50 he 
      paid out, and she pays each other person (including Frank and herself) 
      $10. So, Blanche ends up paying $90 for a necklace worth about $100, and 
      the others make a $10 profit. (In theory it is possible for some ring 
      member never to win a lot and just collect payments from the others, but 
      in practice such a person would be ejected from the ring.) <BR><BR><IMG

      align=right>Interestingly, cartels themselves often have an enforcement 
      problem because it is in the private interest of each member to cheat the 
      others. They are aided in this to some extent because generally the 
      auctioneer does not reveal the name of the winner, and this creates 
      opportunity for ring members to cheat each other and bid privately. One 
      theory is that open formats (English, Dutch) ensure that no ring member 
      exploits the ring by making a side deal simply because it is so easy to 
      monitor compliance amongst ring members. A cheater can be seen calling out 
      his bid. <BR><BR>In the English format, it is thought that collusion 
      problems diminish as the number of bidders increases. Intuitively, a ring 
      will work best if the majority of bidders belong. Intuitively, the more 
      bidders there are, the less likely it is they will all be ring members. 
      <BR><BR>However, intuition is sometimes wrong. Consider the fact that 
      rings are usually formed by choosing only those bidders who might be 
      expected to know that an item has special characteristics causing it to be 
      more valuable than the vendor knows. In this case, a ring would consist of 
      only informed bidders, and uninformed bidders would not be included in the 
      ring. There might indeed be vigorous bidding in the early stages and then 
      when the highest uninformed bidder has finished, one ring member would 
      step up and buy the item. Such an arrangement would actually help the ring 
      members: auctioneers are constantly on the lookout for rings (or possible 
      rings) and vigorous initial bidding would help allay fears. 
      <BR><BR>Generally, it is assumed that such a cartel credibly reveals 
      private information to each other and then chooses a "designated winner" 
      and a bidding strategy. Usually the designated winner is the ring member 
      who has the highest valuation of the object for sale. <BR><BR>Sluggish 
      bidding is a tip-off to the possible presence of a ring. Sometimes the 
      auctioneer refuses to recognize a known ring leader and simply ignores his 
      bid. At other times the auctioneer holds back good merchandise. 
      <BR><BR>Robert Wraight, <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Wraight">[Wraight]</A>an 
      art critic, reveals that sometimes there are inner rings. The outside ring 
      reduces competition in the public auction, and the inner ring pays off 
      unimportant members (impoverished bidders who are knowledgeable and 
      therefore too dangerous to ignore) for a small fee, thus leaving the major 
      advantage to the central few. <BR><BR>An inner ring works like this: A 
      ring of five men buy a painting, they then need to resell it amongst 
      themselves. A, B, and C form an inner ring. A (by prior agreement with B 
      and C) outbids D and E. Later the three inner members (A, B, and C) bid 
      against each other in the third and final auction. <BR><BR>Nearly every 
      regular auction attendee becomes a ring member sooner or later. If you and 
      another antique piggy-bank collector arrive at the same auction and find 
      two good piggies, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that 
      you each buy one without competing. <BR>
      <CENTER>
      <H3>Bidder Tricks </H3></CENTER>Over the years bidders have developed 
      creative ways to deceive auction houses and other bidders. The methods are 
      not always illegal. <BR><BR>Frequently, bidders do not want others to know 
      they are bidding. An example might be a famous art critic who understands 
      that the price of an unknown painting will skyrocket if he is known to be 
      bidding on it. Some bidders hide behind pillars at an auction house, call 
      out or (preferably) signal a bid, and then move to another location. 
      <BR><BR>Sometimes bidders work out hand signals with the auctioneer before 
      the sale. Of course, frequently this is illegal collusion, but at other 
      times the reason can be innocent. There is a story about a man who wanted 
      to buy a certain painting as a surprise for his wife's birthday, but she 
      always went with him to the auctions. He arranged with the auctioneer in 
      advance that he would be bidding as long as his glasses were held in his 
      hand. The ruse was successful, the man won the auction, and his wife 
      learned of her present only on the way home. <BR><BR>Some bidders are 
      quite good at casting doubts on the authenticity or quality of an item. 
      Before an auction they examine the lots and offer opinions as to the poor 
      quality of this or that item. They will then bid and win the goods. 
      <BR><BR>Another trick is to switch rare items from one lot to another. For 
      example, a dishonest bidder could steal a rare letter from Lot 49 and hide 
      it in a group of low-quality letters in Lot 23. He then buys Lot 23 at a 
      low price and nobody notices (at least not until later). An alternate 
      method is to switch the lot numbers marking the groups so that rare items 
      are purchased well below their value. <BR><BR>Some people have been known 
      to steal part of a lot and then offer it for sale to the buyer of the lot. 
      For example, a thief could snip a button from a coat said to have been 
      worn by George Washington and hide it. After the coat is purchased, the 
      thief approaches the winner, says he owns a button that seems to match. 
      The unsuspecting owner often buys the button he already rightfully owns.

      <H3>Auctioneer Tricks </H3></CENTER>Auctioneers, sellers, and auction 
      houses do not lag behind in creativity. Some houses employ a shill to bid 
      up the merchandise and keep the auction active. On the occasions that the 
      shill accidentally winds up buying the merchandise, the auctioneer simply 
      sets the lot aside to be sold at another auction. Alert auction attendees 
      should watch to see if some lots are pushed aside, and sometimes that is a 
      clue that shills are in the audience. <BR><BR>Auction houses have been 
      known to rent an old stately mansion and then advertise an auction full of 
      antiques. There may be genuine antiques present, but also the house may 
      have crammed it full of dealer merchandise. This is known as "salting". 
      <BR><BR>There is also the phenomenon known as the "phantom bidder". 
      Sometimes, in order to keep an auction going (or even to start one) an 
      auctioneer will look to a dark corner of the room and nod as though 
      accepting a bid. This technique is quite successful even in a whole 
      roomful of people. <BR><BR>Another auctioneer trick is to pretend that the 
      <A name=terms.html#reserve></A>reserve price is higher than it really is 
      or even to pretend that there is a reserve price when there is none. A 
      variation on the general theme is to raise a price intentionally under the 
      theory that some people will only bid if the price is high enough. 
      <BR><BR>Some sellers arrange to have an object authenticated falsely. This 
      is simple to accomplish because often an expert's own salary is tied to 
      the price of the item he is authenticating. In other words, an expert 
      promising that a painting really is a Monet will receive more money than 
      if he establishes that the same painting is a fake. <BR><BR>Some 
      auctioneers cheat by dishonest use of the "left" bid. A "left" bid is one 
      which has been deposited by a person unable to attend the auction in 
      person and is that person's maximum bid. For example if a book were 
      auctioned and the people present bid a high of $50, the book would be sold 
      to the absent person who offered a maximum of $100. In such a case, an 
      honest auction house would knock down the book for $55--slightly over the 
      highest in-person bid. Crooked dealers would charge the entire hundred 
      dollars or perhaps cheat by announcing at the beginning of the auction 
      that there was an opening bid of $100 in an effort to realize more than 
      they otherwise might. <BR>
      <CENTER>
      <H3>Which Formats are Most Susceptible to Collusion?</H3></CENTER>ALL 
      auction types can be manipulated. If the stakes are high enough people 
      will find a way to circumvent the rules. Here are a few general theories: 
      <BR><BR>In 1987 Walter Mead <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Mead">[Mead]</A>formulated 
      a hypothesis that the ascending-bid open (English) formats are more 
      susceptible to collusion than are sealed-bid auctions. This belief may 
      explain the popularity of sealed-bid auctions even though ascending-bid 
      formats generate greater revenue. Under the English (ascending, open 
      outcry) scheme, it is easy to form rings. <BR><BR>Sealed-bid auctions, on 
      the other hand, are vulnerable to collusion involving the auctioneer and 
      one or more bidder. This format is less prone to rings because sealed 
      bidding tempts participants to bid higher than the agreed-upon price in 
      order to cheat the others. This is also true for the Dutch format, even 
      though it is an open format since the first defecting bidder ends the 
      auction. Paul Milgrom points out that "collusion is hardest to support 
      when secret price concessions are possible, and easiest to support when 
      all price offers must be made publicly." <BR><BR>The four major formats 
      can be ranked from most prone to collusion to least as follows: (1) 
      English (2) Uniform second-price (3) Discriminatory first-price (4) Dutch. 
      <BR><BR>The English auction is most susceptible to collusion because there 
      is no incentive to betray the ring--more aggressive bidding does not win 
      the item, and also attempts to cheat are visible. For example: Louise 
      values an object at 15, and other buyers in her ring value the object at 
      12. They all agree to bid no more than 5. If someone cheats and bids 7, 
      Louise is willing to go all the way to 15, and so the cheater gains 
      nothing. <BR><BR>In a first-price sealed auction it is hard to prevent 
      buyers from cheating in a one-shot game (only one trading period). After 
      all, by the time the cheater has been discovered, the auction is over. 
      <BR><BR>By the same reasoning, some economists consider that the Dutch 
      auction is the least susceptible to collusion because ring members will 
      have trouble enforcing collusive behavior. When a ring member bids more 
      aggressively than was agreed, his actions are obvious, but once again the 
      auction is over before anyone can react. <BR><BR>Many auction techniques 
      share a serious problem with trust. An auctioneer is required to be 
      totally trustworthy, and that is not easy to attain or certify. Consider, 
      for example, that an auctioneer has great opportunity and motivation to 
      cheat in a second-price sealed-bid auction. He need only open the bids and 
      insert a bid just slightly under the highest bid offered. His profits 
      would increase. <BR><BR>Matthew K. <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Franklin">Franklin</A> 
      and Michael K. Reiter point out that "there are numerous possibilities for 
      corruption and misbehavior in a sealed-bid auction. Possibly the most 
      difficult to counter are those that involve the misbehavior of 
      <I>agents</I> in charge of executing and overseeing the auction (e.g., 
      employees of the auction house), especially when this behavior involves 
      collaboration with certain bidders."<BR><BR>They list several ways to 
      cheat:<BR><BR>The agent opens bids prior to the close of the bidding 
      period and informs a collaborator of the amounts bid. <BR><BR>An agent 
      closes the bidding period prematurely so as to preclude certain bids. 
      <BR><BR>The agent allows a bidder to withdraw (or insert) his bid after 
      the bidding period has ended. <BR><BR>The agent collects money from losing 
      bidders. <BR><BR>The winning bidder refuses to pay claiming insufficient 
      funds.<BR><BR>In the future, as more and more auctions are conducted via 
      computer, the above problems must be addressed. <BR>
