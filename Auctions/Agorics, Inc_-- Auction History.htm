      <H2>Auction History </H2></CENTER>(Most of these historical facts come 
      from Ralph Casady's book, Auctions and Auctioneering.) [<A

      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>Some scholars 
      argue that the very first auction occurred when Joseph of the Many-Colored 
      Coat was sold into slavery by his brothers, however the first generally 
      accepted auctions occurred in Babylon in about 500 B.C. In those times an 
      auction was held annually, and women were sold on condition that they be 
      married. Beautiful maidens engendered lively bidding, but less comely 
      women had to pay a dowry to be accepted and thus the price could be 
      negative. <BR><BR>Ancient Romans also auctioned goods. Those auctions were 
      held in the "atrium auctionarium", and the trading was carried out by four 
      functionaries: the dominus, on whose behalf the property was sold; the 
      argentarius, who organized, regulated, and possibly financed the sale; the 
      praeco, who advertised and promoted the auction as well as conducted the 
      bidding; and the emptor, the highest bidder (recall caveat emptor, let the 
      buyer beware.). It is not known whether the auctions were ascending or 
      descending, but ascending is presumed since auctus means increase. Bidders 
      normally did not call out openly, but rather winked or waved to indicate a 
      bid. <BR><BR>After a military victory a Roman soldier would plant his 
      spear in the ground to mark the location of his spoils. Later he would put 
      these goods up for sale at auctions. The now-rare term, subhastation, 
      meaning a sale by auction, came from the Latin, subhastare (to sell by 
      public auction) which in turn comes from sub (under) and hasta (spear). 
      Subhastare--under the spear. Roman business agents were said to have 
      accompanied warriors into battle to facilitate the expected sales. 
      <BR><BR>The Romans also used the auction to liquidate property. Marcus 
      Aurelius is said to have auctioned off prized heirlooms and furniture 
      (that auction lasted over two months). <BR><BR><IMG height=256 alt=Sidebar

      align=right><BR>One of the most astonishing auctions in history occurred 
      in the year 193 A.D. when no less than the entire Roman Empire was tossed 
      on the block by the Praetorian Guard. First they killed Pertinax, the 
      emperor, and then they announced that the highest bidder could claim the 
      Empire. Didius Julianus outbid all comers and became the emperor for the 
      price of 6,250 drachmas per Guard. Unfortunately, he was beheaded a mere 
      two months later when Septimus Severus conquered Rome. Julianus may have 
      been the first victim of winner's curse. Later, the Empire was restored to 
      the people. <BR><BR>Less is understood about the auction as used in other 
      civilizations. It is known that the auction was one of the four 
      money-raising institutions (the others being pawnshops, mutual financing 
      associations, and lotteries) used by Buddhist temples and monasteries, and 
      as early as the seventh century, the possessions of deceased monks were 
      sold on the block. <BR><BR>The earliest reference to the auction as 
      practiced in Great Britain is from an entry in the 1595 Oxford English 
      Dictionary, but nothing more is known until the final years of the 
      seventeenth century. At that time auctions were held in taverns and 
      coffeehouses to sell art. It is likely that such auctions were held daily 
      and that catalogs, announcing the availability of certain merchandise, 
      were printed. <BR><BR>The firm of <A href="http://www.sothebys.com/" 
      target=_BLANK>Sotheby's</A> was established in 1744, and Christie's was 
      founded in 1766. <BR><BR>Terms of sale were largely the same in the 
      eighteenth century as now: [<A

      <P>1). High bidder is the buyer. If a dispute arises as to which bid is 
      highest, goods will be put up for sale again. <BR><BR>2). No bidder may 
      advance another's bid by less than six pence when the amount offered is 
      less than one pound, or by less than one shilling when the price is one 
      pound or more. <BR><BR>3) Merchandise for sale is warranted as perfect, 
      and before removing goods from premises, any buyer may accept or reject 
      them. <BR><BR>4). Each buyer must give his name and make a deposit of 5 
      shillings on each pound sterling (if demanded); no deliveries will be made 
      during the sale. <BR><BR>5). All purchases must be taken away at the 
      buyer's expense, and the amount due shall be paid within three days of 
      purchase. <BR><BR>6). Any would-be buyer unable to attend the sale may 
      have his commission executed by a representative of the auction 
      firm.<BR><BR>One seventeenth century catalog describes a process called 
      "mineing", which was similar to the Dutch auction because the auctioneer 
      started the bidding high and worked down. A lot was claimed when someone 
      yelled, "Mine". There was an interesting twist though. After the bid 
      descended to the point where a bidder claimed an item, the bidding 
      actually resumed but this time in an ascending format. So the bids went 
      down and then back up again. <BR><BR>The auction migrated to America where 
      it was used to liquidate goods and to sell unsalable goods at the end of a 
      season. Domestic animals have been sold this way as have tobacco, natural 
      resources, horses, debt, credit, and, of course, slaves. </P>
