      <H2 align=center>Auction Types -- English</H2>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>An important 
      observation must be made before discussing the various auction formats and 
      that is that people generally have one of two motivations for 
      participating in an auction of any type. The first reason is when a bidder 
      wishes to acquire goods for personal consumption (wine or fresh flowers), 
      and in this case the bidder makes his own private valuation of the item 
      for sale. All bidders have <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#private-value">private 
      valuations</A> and tend to keep that information private. There would be 
      little point in an auction if the seller knew already how much the highest 
      valuation of an object will be. 
      <P>The second reason for bidding in an auction is to acquire items for 
      resale or commercial use. In this case, an individual bid is predicated 
      not only upon a private valuation reached independently, but also upon an 
      estimate of future valuations of later buyers. Each bidder of this type 
      tries (using the same measurements) to guess the ultimate price of the 
      item. In other words, the item is really worth the same to all, but the 
      exact amount is unknown. This is called a <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#common-value">common-value</A> 
      assumption, and one example is that of art purchased solely for promotion 
      in some secondary market. Purchasing land for its mineral rights is 
      another example. Each bidder has different information and a different 
      valuation, but each must guess what price the land might ultimately bring. 
      </P>
      <P>People's bidding behavior changes depending upon which motivation is 
      driving them. </P>
      <P>William Vickrey [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Vickrey">Vickrey</A>] 
      established the basic taxonomy of auctions based upon the order in which 
      prices are quoted and the manner in which bids are tendered. He 
      established four major (<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#oneside">one 
      sided</A>) auction types. </P>
      <P>The English auction is the format most familiar to Americans and is 
      known also as the open-outcry auction or the ascending-price auction. It 
      is used commonly to sell art, wine and numerous other goods. </P>
      <P>Paul Milgrom [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Milgrom-1">Milgrom-1</A>] 
      defines the English auction in the following way. "Here the auctioneer 
      begins with the lowest acceptable price--the reserve price-- and proceeds 
      to solicit successively higher bids from the customers until no one will 
      increase the bid. The item is 'knocked down' (sold) to the highest 
      bidder." </P>
      <P>Contrary to popular belief, not all goods at an auction are actually 
      knocked down. In some cases, when a reserve price is not met, the item is 
      not sold. (In other instances discussed later, an item is not really sold 
      because a shill from the auction house has accidentally bought it.) Some 
      states require the auctioneer to state at the conclusion of bidding 
      whether or not the item has been sold. </P>
      <P>Sometimes the auctioneer will maintain secrecy about the <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#reserve">reserve 
      price</A>, and he must start the bidding without revealing the lowest 
      acceptable price. One possible explanation for the secrecy is to thwart 
      rings (subsets of bidders who have banded together and agree not to outbid 
      each other, thus effectively lowering the winning bid). <BR><IMG

      align=right> </P>
      <P>Despite its seeming simplicity, this auction format is quite complex. 
      Often bids are not made aloud, but rather signaled--tugging the ear, 
      raising a bidding paddle, etc. This system of signaling has several 
      advantages. First, an auction hall would be bedlam if voices were 
      required. Audible bids increase the likelihood of error because there may 
      be more than one person bidding at a single instant and an auctioneer 
      cannot be expected to hear them all. </P>
      <P>Many traders prefer the semi-anonymity--a known expert in a certain 
      field may not want others to know he is bidding because it would probably 
      increase the bidding interest. When a decision to accept signals is made, 
      a system of price intervals must be introduced so that seller and buyer 
      understand the signals. In certain situations, an auctioneer has wide 
      discretion. In America the auctioneer often calls out the amount he has in 
      hand and the amount he is seeking as well. In England, however, often the 
      auctioneer does not lead bidders this way, but rather waits to be told 
      what a bidder will offer. </P>
      <P>Adding to the complexity, competition is at its highest in the English 
      auction, with some bidders becoming carried away with enthusiasm. <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#winnerc">Winner's 
      curse </A>( paying more for an item than its value) is widespread in this 
      type of auction because inexperienced participants bid up the price. </P>
      <P>One variation on the open-outcry auction is the open-exit auction in 
      which the prices rise continuously, but players must publicly announce 
      that they are dropping out when the price is too high. Once a bidder has 
      dropped out, he may not reenter. This variation provides more information 
      about the valuations (common or public) of others than when players can 
      drop out secretly (and sometimes even reenter later). </P>
      <P>In another variation, an auctioneer calls out each asking price and 
      bidders lift a paddle to indicate a willingness to pay that amount. Then 
      the auctioneer calls out another price etc. </P>
      <P>In the ascending-bid format, the auctioneer can exert great influence. 
      He can manipulate bidders with his voice, his tone, and his personality. 
      He can increase the pace or even refuse to notice certain bidders (for 
      example, if he believes someone is a member of a ring, the auctioneer 
      might choose to ignore him). </P>
      <P>Eric Rasmusen [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Rasmusen">Rasmusen</A>] 
      mentions one unusual variation on the English auction that occurs in 
      France. After the last bid of an open-cry art auction, a representative of 
      the Louvre has the right to raise his hand and say, "préemption de l' 
      état" and take the painting at the highest price. It might be noted that 
      in France, the auction privilege (the right to conduct an auction ) is 
      sold to a select few individuals (some 500 throughout the country) by the 
      central government. This privilege is called the chargé. </P>
      <P>The key to any successful auction (from a seller's point of view) is 
      the effect of competition on the potential buyers. In an English auction, 
      the underbidder usually forces the bid up by one small step at a time. 
      Often a successful bidder acquires an object for considerably less than 
      his maximum valuation simply because he need only increase each bid by a 
      small increment. In other words, the seller does not necessarily receive 
      maximum value, and other auction types may be superior to the English 
      auction for this reason (at least from the seller's perspective). [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Varian">Varian</A>] 
      </P>
      <P>Another disadvantage to the English system is that a buyer must be 
      present which may be difficult and/or expensive. Finally, this auction 
      type is highly susceptible to <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#rings">rings</A>.
