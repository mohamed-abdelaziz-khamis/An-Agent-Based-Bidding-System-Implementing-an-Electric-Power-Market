      <H2>Government Securities--the Scandal of '91 </H2></CENTER>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>Each year the the 
      U.S. Treasury Department offers several trillion dollars of debt. Thirteen 
      and twenty-six week maturities are auctioned weekly on Mondays; longer 
      maturities are offered several times each year. Each week the Treasury 
      Department announces the amount of debt it will auction off the next week. 
      The market can be thought of as a "forward" market that serves both to 
      allocate and to evaluate. Auction results are considered an indication of 
      the way institutions regard the fiscal policies of Congress and the 
      President and their own beliefs about the marketability of the securities. 
      <BR><BR>It should be mentioned that treasuries are sold in terms of yield, 
      but for simplification the word "price" will be used here. In general, two 
      types of bids are allowed. Competitive bids are for large markets such as 
      money market banks, dealers, institutions. Non-competitive bids are the 
      small scale bidders open to the public. <BR><BR>There are thirty-nine 
      "primary dealers", institutions allowed to participate in the competitive 
      bidding. They submit bids specifying the price they will pay and the 
      number of securities desired. Up until the recent past the U.S. Treasury 
      used the <A name=terms.html#discriminatory></A>discriminatory sealed-bid 
      auction (first price) which means that winners paid different prices with 
      some people paying a great deal less than others. The came the great 
      Salomon Brothers disaster. <BR><BR><IMG height=256 alt=Sidebar

      width=237 align=right><BR>In August of 1991, Salomon Brothers, Inc. 
      admitted that it had seriously violated U.S. Treasury auction rules by 
      submitting fraudulent bids a year earlier. (They ended up paying a fine of 
      $290 million.) Also in 1991 there were two other successful efforts to 
      manipulate the market. A huge uproar resulted and hearings were held to 
      determine whether or not to change the type of auction used to sell 
      securities. This attracted considerable attention as one might expect when 
      billions are at stake. <BR><BR>As early as 1959 Milton Friedman spoke 
      before the Joint Economic Committee urging a switch to the <A 
      name=terms.html#uniform></A>uniform-price auction system (Vickrey--all new 
      issues awarded at the same amount which is equal to the highest losing 
      bid). In fact, the Treasury did experiment briefly in the 1970's but 
      changed back when results proved inconclusive. Many believe the experiment 
      was abandoned too quickly, and the Salomon Brothers disaster prompted a 
      reopening of the matter. Milton Friedman spoke and wrote again on the same 
      subject in 1991.<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#MFriedman">[Milton 
      Friedman]</A><BR><BR>Merton Miller (winner of the 1990 Nobel Prize in 
      economics) also argued in 1992 in favor of experimenting again with the 
      uniform, second-price auction. Other people appeared before Congress 
      urging a switch to the Dutch auction (in financial markets the term 
      "Dutch" means the Vickrey auction.) Chari and Weber <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Chari">[Chari]</A> 
      argued that a switch to a uniform-price auction would be a good change 
      because participants would be less inclined to acquire information about 
      other bidders because there would be less market manipulation. The 
      discriminatory format strongly encourages bidders to learn about their 
      competitor's valuations. <BR><BR>A number of arguments make the Vickrey 
      auction more attractive. A Vickrey auction tends to mute "winner's curse" 
      and therefore increases revenue to the Treasury because bidders are more 
      aggressive in that format. Also, the Vickrey method is considered less 
      prone to collusion (one group cornering the market such as in the Salomon 
      Brothers case). In general, the Vickrey auction is a simpler auction type, 
      requires less bid preparation time, is less costly, and allows for greater 
      bidder participation. <BR><BR>An argument against the experiment is that 
      it is believed that interest rates have less to do with how securities are 
      sold than with demand. Another compelling argument against the Vickrey 
      auction is that a market manipulator could place bids for a substantial 
      portion of some issue at a price considerably higher than the expected 
      market consensus. This would ensure significant awards but the winner 
      would pay only the second-highest price. Of course if more than one bidder 
      attempts this, someone would pay dearly. <BR><BR>It was agreed to 
      experiment for a year with the new technique. The government hoped that 
      pension funds and other large investors would bid. As of this writing the 
      results have been inconclusive and the experiment continues.

      reported that the government possibly saved money on two-year notes but 
      may have lost money on the five-year notes. More people did participate as 
      hoped. <BR>
