      <H2>The Double Auction </H2></CENTER>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>Although not 
      classified as one of the major four auction types, the double auction has 
      been the principal trading format in U.S. financial institutions for over 
      a hundred years. 
      <P>In this auction both sellers and buyers submit bids which are then 
      ranked highest to lowest to generate demand and supply profiles. From the 
      profiles, the maximum quantity exchanged can be determined by matching 
      selling offers (starting with lowest price and moving up) with demand bids 
      (starting with highest price and moving down). This format allows buyers 
      to make offers and sellers to accept those offers at any particular 
      moment. It can be confusing to think about the double auction in light of 
      overlapping buy and sell orders. A good way to avoid this confusion is to 
      understand that at one single instant of time, they do not overlap. </P>
      <P>It works like this: Suppose 4 sellers of foreign exchange offer to sell 
      one unit at prices of 100, 200, 300, and 400 units of domestic currency, 
      and 4 demanders of foreign exchange offer to buy one unit at prices of 
      400, 300, 250, and 50 units of domestic currency. Supply and demand are 
      met at three units of foreign exchange but the price would remain 
      indeterminate, falling somewhere between 200 and 250. [<A

      <P>The origins of the double auction are not well known, but it is 
      recognized that this form of auction has roots that go back to ancient 
      Egypt and Mesopotamia. Almost certainly the double auction stems from 
      "haggling" in which buyer and seller each suggest prices. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#DFriedman">Friedman, 
      Daniel</A>] </P>
      <P>Much later (in the last quarter of the nineteenth century) when the 
      telegraph and telephone were invented, traders in the stock market could 
      speak directly to interested outside investors. This was viewed at the 
      time not only as a novelty but also as something of a threat. The computer 
      revolution of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries portend far greater 
      shifts as agents and financial markets become automated. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#DFriedman">Friedman, 
      Daniel</A>] </P>
      <P>A "continuous double auction" is one in which many individual 
      transactions are carried on at a single moment and trading does not stop 
      as each auction is concluded. The pit of the Chicago Commodities market is 
      an example of a continuous double auction and the New York Stock Exchange 
      is another. In those institutions a specialist matches bids and asking 
      prices to find matches. </P>
      <P>One interesting variation is the Double Dutch auction. Work on this is 
      being done at the University of Arizona. [<A

      </P>
      <P>It works like this: A buyer price clock starts ticking at a very high 
      price and continues downward. At some point the buyer stops the clock and 
      bids on the unit at a price favorable to him. At this point a seller clock 
      starts upward from a very low price and continues to ascend until stopped 
      by a seller who then offers a unit at that price. Then the buyer clock 
      resumes in a downward direction. The trading period is over when the two 
      prices cross, and at that point all purchases are made at the crossover 
      point. </P>
      <P>The DA (double auction) has many variants and is evolving rapidly. 
      Economists believe that the double auction will have many applications as 
      auctions become computerized. </P>
