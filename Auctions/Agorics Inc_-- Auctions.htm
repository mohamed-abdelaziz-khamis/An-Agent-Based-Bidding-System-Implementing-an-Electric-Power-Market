      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>What exactly is an 
      auction? You've seen auctions in movies, you've read about them, you've 
      probably participated and believe nothing could be more simple, right? 
      Someone bids, the price goes up, someone else bids, and when everyone is 
      silent, the object is sold. Well . . . sometimes. 
      <P>More to the point, why does it matter? Perhaps because auctions are a 
      multi-billion dollar business, and the mortgage rate you pay is determined 
      in part by auctions held by the U.S. Treasury. Perhaps because that 
      particular auction is not the kind of auction you think it is. Perhaps 
      because some bidders spend years mastering strategies that enable them to 
      exploit the misunderstandings of the unwary. And perhaps because smart 
      auction principles can be used to buy and sell computer resources in a way 
      that substantially optimizes human time and money. However, before all 
      that, what exactly is an auction? </P>
      <P>Even the term auction (root, "auctio", means increase) is a misnomer 
      because not all auctions have ascending price schemes. In fact, there are 
      many different auction formats including the familiar ascending bid, but 
      also including the descending, sealed-bid, simultaneous, handshake, and 
      whispered forms of bidding. Many of the more unusual formats have been 
      practiced for hundreds of years including one variety in which huge 
      estates have been sold during the time it took for a single one-inch 
      candle stub to flicker out. </P>
      <P>Auctions are useful when selling a commodity of undetermined quality. 
      Banks compete for loan customers of uncertain risk, graduate schools 
      compete for students of unknown ability, [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Vincent">Vincent</A>] 
      wine merchants may not have tasted the wares. Auctions can be used for 
      single items such as a work of art and for multiple units of a homogeneous 
      item such as gold or Treasury securities. For countries changing from 
      centrally-planned to market-based economies, auctions offer an ability to 
      value goods that might not otherwise be available. They are useful in 
      circumstances wherein the goods do not have a fixed or determined market 
      value, in other words, when a seller is unsure of the price he can get. 
      </P>
      <P>Choosing to sell an item by auctioning it off is more flexible than 
      setting a fixed price and less time-consuming and expensive than 
      negotiating a price (such as happens in a car lot). In a price 
      negotiation, each bid and counter-bid is considered separately, but in an 
      auction the competing bids are offered almost simultaneously. </P>
      <P>In fact, an auctionable resource can be nearly anything--public land, 
      livestock, wine, flowers, fish, cars, construction contracts, equity 
      shares, or contracts in the game of bridge. The common denominator is that 
      the value of each item varies enough to preclude direct and absolute 
      pricing. In one fascinating experiment, external offices (with prized 
      windows and locations) were auctioned off as a way of solving the quandary 
      of how to allocate physical resources at Arizona State University's 
      College of Business without infuriating the entire staff. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Boyes">Boyes</A>] 
      </P>
      <P>Simply stated, an auction is a method of allocating scarce goods, a 
      method that is based upon competition. It is the purest of markets: a 
      seller wishes to obtain as much money as possible, and a buyer wants to 
      pay as little as necessary. An auction offers the advantage of simplicity 
      in determining market-based prices. It is efficient in the sense that an 
      auction usually ensures that resources accrue to those who value them most 
      highly and ensures also that sellers receive the collective assessment of 
      the value. (In later chapters, we will see that sellers do not necessarily 
      receive maximum value in the ascending-bid format. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Varian">Varian</A>]) 
      What is unique about the auction is that the price is set not by the 
      seller, but by the bidders. </P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is the seller who sets the rules by choosing the 
      type of auction to be used. </P>
      <P>One oddity regularly occurs in the wine auction market. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Ashenfelter">Ashenfelter</A>] 
      It is commonly understood in wine circles that when identical lots of wine 
      are peddled at the same auction, later lots are frequently sold for a 
      lower price than early lots. Auctioneers know this but are reluctant to 
      reveal this information to inexperienced participants because such bidders 
      often conclude that the auction house is dishonest. Thus, auctioneers have 
      learned to disguise this anomaly by offering small lots of wine A before 
      offering larger lots of wine A. People assume the reason for the price 
      difference comes from a quantity discount, and so they pay no attention. 
      In fact, the difference is real. </P>
      <P>An auction is unusual also in that, unlike other methods of selling, 
      generally the auctioneer doesn't own the goods, but acts rather, as an 
      agent for someone who does. Frequently, the buyers know more than the 
      seller about the value of the item. A seller, not wanting to suggest a 
      price first out of fear that his ignorance will prove costly, holds an 
      auction to extract information he might not otherwise realize. </P>
      <P>There are different ways to classify auctions. There are open auctions 
      as well as sealed-bid auctions. There are auctions where the price ascends 
      and auctions where the price drops at regular intervals. Generally, 
      experts agree that there are four major <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#oneside">one-sided 
      auction</A> formats: English, Dutch, First-Price sealed-bid, and Vickrey 
      (uniform second-price). One difficulty is the lack of commonality in 
      naming conventions. What some people call a uniform second-price auction 
      is known in financial communities as a Dutch auction, and no end of 
      confusion results. </P>
      <P><IMG height=184 alt=Sidebar

      align=right>Which auction is best? The answer depends upon many variables. 
      A seller's perspective is different from that of a buyer. Some auctions 
      types decrease the incentives to cheat while others provide ample room for 
      mischief. Sometimes speed is important. If you are selling flowers or 
      fresh fish or anything that has to get to market quickly, an auction that 
      takes weeks or even hours is not a good solution. In some auctions the 
      buyer must be present, and that is sub-optimal if the auction is in New 
      York and you are in Tokyo. Different circumstances dictate different 
      answers. </P>
      <P>Sometimes an auction is useful in hindering dishonest dealings. If the 
      mayor of New York were free to accept the first bid made by a contractor 
      on a new city building, the contractor would probably be a relative and 
      the taxpayers would lose money (again). </P>
      <P>Are there drawbacks to auctions? Of course. "<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#winnerc">Winners 
      curse</A>" is widely recognized as being that phenomenon when a "lucky" 
      winner pays more for an item than it is worth. Auction winners are faced 
      with the sudden realization that their valuation of an object is higher 
      than that of anyone else. </P>
      <P>In auctions in which no bidder is sure of the worth of the good being 
      auctioned, the winner is the bidder who made the highest guess. If bidders 
      have reasonable information about the worth of the item, then the average 
      of all the guesses is likely to be correct. The winner, however, offered 
      the bid furthest from the actual value. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Thaler">Thaler</A>] 
      (Actually, winner's curse is everywhere in subtle forms. Do you really 
      want to hire the employee who has been passed over by other employers? Do 
      you want to be the publisher who buys a manuscript that other editors have 
      rejected?) </P>
      <P>All in all, the auction, though not always as simple as it appears, can 
      be thought of as a pure marketplace at work in its finest form. <BR></P>
