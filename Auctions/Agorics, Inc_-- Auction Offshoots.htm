      <H3>The Simultaneous Bidding System </H3></CENTER>In the simultaneous 
      format (also known as the Japanese system) all bids are offered by 
      prospective buyers at (almost) the same time using individual hand signals 
      for each monetary unit. In theory, all bidding occurs at exactly the same 
      moment, but in practice it takes several minutes for buyers to get their 
      hands in the air and also for the auctioneer to read the signals. The 
      winner is the highest bidder, and all bidders are expected to register 
      their maximum bids within the allotted moments. In practice, some bidders 
      manage to see the bids of others and raise their own within the time 
      allowed. <BR><BR>Each of the hand signs represents a number from one to 
      nine. Two- or three-digit numbers are indicated by rapidly repeated hand 
      signals. The use of two-digit numbers is not always necessary if the 
      auctioneer and bidders know a particular bidding level, and in a case such 
      as this, the bids may be partly inferential. For example, a man signaling 
      three may actually be bidding three hundred (in much the same way that one 
      American real estate agent might tell another that a certain house is 
      selling for seven when she means seven hundred thousand dollars). 
      <BR><BR>This form of bidding is extremely fast which is important in the 
      fresh food markets of Japan when time lost means fish that cannot be sold. 
      It is characterized by great noise and confusion as many bidders try to 
      gain the attention of one auctioneer. <BR>

      <H3>Haphazard Systems </H3></CENTER>Ralph Cassady [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Cassady">Cassady</A>] 
      refers to several auction types collectively as "haphazard" formats 
      meaning that in each system every bidder communicates privately to the 
      auctioneer who then considers the bid and later announces the winner. It 
      is haphazard in that the bidding is not required to either ascend or 
      descend, but instead is carried out in some random order. <BR>
      <H4>The Written-bid Auction</H4>This format, sometimes called the "dumb" 
      scheme, requires all bids to arrive in written form. In that respect it is 
      very much like the sealed-bid system used to award housing contracts, but 
      there are a couple of differences. In a sealed-bid scheme awarding a 
      housing contract, the bidders are actually sellers more than they are 
      buyers. In addition, housing contracts are granted after a period of weeks 
      or even months, whereas in the written-bid system, participants have but a 
      few moments to formulate and tender their bids. It has been used in Japan 
      to sell dried fish. <BR><BR>It works this way: Bidders (after examining 
      the various lots for sale) deposit their bids in a box which is then 
      handed to an auctioneer. After some agreed-upon time interval has expired, 
      the auctioneer announces the winner (if the reserve price has been met). 
      This is a relatively slow method especially when the lots are put up 
      separately. Consider that if each bidding period averages three minutes, 
      then only twenty lots can be sold in an hour. Time may not be important in 
      a market of imperishables (dried fish), but busy sellers and buyers object 
      to spending long hours in a process that can be accomplished faster. 
      <BR><BR>One way of speeding up this type of auction is to offer several 
      lots simultaneously, but this can prove cumbersome. Often a buyer only 
      wants to bid on a certain lot only if he has been unsuccessful in winning 
      others. For example, if a participant has $500 to spend, he cannot bid 
      intelligently on Lot B until he learns if he has won Lot A, and if so, how 
      much he has paid for it. If too many lots are offered simultaneously, the 
      participant cannot know which lots he has won until the entire auction is 
      complete. Another disadvantage is that a bidder has little flexibility. If 
      he wants something, he must bid high. He could possibly attain the goods 
      for less under the English system by raising his bid one step higher than 
      the competitor. <BR><BR><IMG height=193 alt=Sidebar

      <H4>The Handshake Auction</H4>The handshake format is one of oldest 
      auction schemes in existence. Buyers communicate their bids to an 
      auctioneer by squeezing his fingers in a certain prescribed manner. This 
      method originated in China and was used until the late 1950's. <BR><BR>It 
      works as follows: A group of bidders stand in a circle around the 
      auctioneer and each, in turn, clasps the hand of the auctioneer. The hands 
      are hidden under a cloth and so only the bidder and the auctioneer know 
      the amount of the bid. The potential buyer indicates a bid by pressing 
      some number of the auctioneer's fingers and simultaneously announcing 
      aloud the monetary unit, first "tens", then "rupees", then "anas". 
      Multiple squeezes offer flexibility to the bidder--a bid of twenty can be 
      offered either by squeezing two fingers simultaneously or by squeezing one 
      finger twice while announcing the unit as ten. <BR><BR>The auctioneer is 
      expected to remember each bid, and he announces the winner after all have 
      taken a turn (one turn per bidder). The actual amount of the sale is kept 
      secret, and of course this offers the auctioneer an opportunity for 
      collusion. <BR><BR>Adroit bidders frequently want to mislead the 
      competitors and have learned deceptive techniques. If, for example, a 
      bidder wants to convince others that his bid is lower than it really is, 
      he can grasp all fingers including the thumb, announce the smallest unit 
      (tens), and squeeze repeatedly and quickly. <BR><BR>If he wants to 
      convince others he is making a high bid, he can grasp only one finger and 
      announce a larger unit. <BR><BR>Sometimes a bidder doesn't wish to bid on 
      a certain lot but still wants to hide this from others. In such a case, he 
      can take the auctioneer's hand, make some bid and then cancel it by 
      scratching the auctioneer's palm while he announces the monetary unit. 
      <BR><BR>The handshake method is very time-consuming. <BR>
      <H4>The Whisper Auction</H4>In this system, the auctioneer announces that 
      an item is for sale, and buyers whisper their bids in his ear. As in other 
      haphazard auctions, the bids have no pattern and participants offer bids 
      without knowledge of the bids of others. This method is used in some fish 
      markets (Venice, Singapore). Like the handshake method, the whisper 
      auction is very time-consuming. <BR><BR>The whisper auction and the 
      handshake format do offer a singular advantage to the seller and that is 
      that a seller can ignore certain bids or bidders. For example, a seller 
      will not want to consider the offers of people known to be bad credit 
      risks and in this method, the seller does not announce the winning bid. 
      The bidder, of course, has no motivation to reveal pricing information. 
      Another advantage to sellers is that the whisper method keeps them well 
      informed of the demand for fish. Management can price fish intelligently 
      with this information, however, the opportunity for auctioneer collusion 
      certainly exists. <BR>

      <H4>The Time-Interval Auction</H4>Basically, the format of a time-interval 
      auction is similar to an English (ascending bid) form, however all bidding 
      must be completed within a certain time allotment. An advantage to bidders 
      is the ability to revise a bid upward. Also, the bids are public which 
      means that a bidder need raise his bid only slightly to beat the 
      competition. The time-interval method is used in the real-estate market 
      and, more recently, in the manuscript market where publishers bid on high 
      profit manuscripts within certain time limits. In the real-estate and 
      manuscript markets an auction can consume days or weeks. Other 
      time-interval auctions can be completed in the time it takes for sand to 
      pour through an hourglass. <BR><IMG height=211 alt=Sidebar 
      src="Agorics, Inc_-- Auction Offshoots_files/auct7quo2.gif" width=201 
      align=right><BR>One of the very oldest time-interval auctions is that in 
      which a burning candle is used to measure total bidding time, and this 
      method has been used to sell property as recently as the early twentieth 
      century. <BR><BR>It works as follows: A circle of people gather together 
      out of the wind. One of them cuts a candle to a length of about one inch 
      and then lights it. Participants call out their bids in ascending order as 
      they keep one eye on the flame. The winner is the person who made the 
      highest bid before the candle flickered out. An offshoot used sometimes in 
      Cornish auctions, requires the auctioneer to insert a pin one inch below 
      the top of the candle. As long as the pin stays in place, the bidding can 
      continue. When the pin drops, the auction is over and the goods are sold. 
      <BR><BR>Interesting bidding strategies are used in a candle lit auction. 
      Sometimes a participant will make a high bid early on to scare off the 
      competition. Another technique is to wait until the final moments before 
      offering a comparatively high bid. This usually forces opponents to 
      rethink the matter, but before they have time to do so, the auction is 
      over. Mostly, however, participants bid actively throughout. Sometimes all 
      bidders adopt the strategy of waiting until the final moments and then a 
      glut of bids come at the end making it hard to determine a winner. <BR>
      <H4>The Silent Auction</H4>The silent auction is a variation of the 
      written-bid auction, (and also the English auction) but in this format the 
      participants bid knowing how much competitors have offered, and so prices 
      move steadily upward. Would-be buyers enter their names on a sheet of 
      paper next to the amount they are willing to bid. (The sheet of paper 
      contains the minimum acceptable bid if applicable.) Bidders can thus check 
      to see the current high bid while they consider their options. This 
      auction can take place over a period of hours or days. <BR><BR>Bidding 
      strategies include waiting for the last minute to bid (thus lulling the 
      competition into false security) or bidding high immediately to discourage 
      competition. <BR><BR>My husband and I participated in one silent auction 
      in which there was an unusual (and unfortunate) result. We had been 
      bidding with great spirit for a jar of chocolate truffles, and as time 
      wore on, our competition was reduced to one other bidder. Moments before 
      the final bell rang, my husband entered what he assumed to be the winning 
      bid, and we sat down to dinner to watch the rest of the program (which 
      included the announcement of winners). Unfortunately, our competitor (who 
      was assisting the auctioneer) sneaked over after the final bell, crossed 
      off our bid and wrote in a new one. At this writing my husband is still 
      angry. <BR>
      <H4>The Audible-Bid Rotation Auction</H4>In the handshake auction, each 
      bidder takes his turn and all the bids are kept secret. In the audible-bid 
      rotation method, bidders also alternate in a rotation pattern, but the 
      bidding is open. As in the English auction, the bids are ascending (not 
      haphazard). The auctioneer writes the current high bid on a blackboard and 
      erases it as larger bids are made. Each bidder, in turn, either raises his 
      bid or passes. The merchandise is awarded to the highest bidder at the 
      highest price. <BR>
      <H4>The Swiss Auction</H4>The Swiss construction industry awards contracts 
      on a first-price, sealed-bid basis. [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Von-Ungern-Sternberg">Von 
      Ungern-Sternberg</A>] What is unusual about the Swiss auction is that if 
      the designated winner does not wish to accept the project, the architects 
      will usually (but not always) allow him to withdraw the bid. The bid 
      itself may not be modified, but the winner can choose whether to accept or 
      refuse the project. There are very practical reasons for this auction. 
      <BR><BR>Architects argue in favor of this method because timetables and 
      specifications nearly always require modification and there is no point in 
      working with a contractor who doesn't want a certain job. <BR><BR>A Swiss 
      auction also takes into account certain constraints on the part of the 
      construction company. Construction companies often have to bid on more 
      than one project at a time which affects timing, cost overruns, labor 
      availability. Frequently the specifications change on a current job and 
      thus they cannot predict their own future availability. It is reasonable 
      to let them withdraw if they cannot meet the contract specifications. Only 
      when there is a significant difference (say, ten percent) between the 
      winning bid and the second-highest bid, is the winner forced to accept the 
      job. <BR><BR>The ability to withdraw is not written formally into the 
      rules because of the open invitation to cheat. A high bidder could 
      approach the second-highest bidder, offer to withdraw, and obtain a nice 
      side payment. A certain amount of discretion is given to the auctioneer to 
      avoid this; the auctioneer can force a company to meet its bid. 
      <BR><BR>The overall effect is that often contractors bid more aggressively 
      because they have this option that allows for flexibility.
