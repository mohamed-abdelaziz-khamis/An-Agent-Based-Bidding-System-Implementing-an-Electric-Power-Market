      <H2>Auctions -- The Vickrey Auction </H2>
      <CENTER>
      <H2>(Uniform second-price) </H2></CENTER>
      <H4>-by Kate Reynolds </H4>
      <H4>One in a Series of Articles from Agorics, Inc. </H4>The uniform 
      second-price auction is commonly called the Vickrey auction, named after 
      William Vickrey, [<A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/bibliography.html#Vickrey">Vickrey</A>] 
      winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, who classified it in 
      the 1960s. Like the first-price auction, the bids are sealed, and each 
      bidder is ignorant of other bids. (In the financial community, the 
      uniform, second-price auction is called the Dutch auction, but in these 
      papers we will use the academic names.) 
      <P>The item is awarded to highest bidder at a price equal to the 
      second-highest bid (or highest unsuccessful bid). In other words, a winner 
      pays less than the highest bid. If, for example, bidder A bids $10, bidder 
      B bids $15, and bidder C offers $20, bidder C would win, however he would 
      only pay the price of the second-highest bid, namely $15. </P>
      <P>There is one interesting and crucial point and that is that when 
      auctioning multiple units, all winning bidders pay for the items at the 
      same price (the highest losing price). We will see later that the U.S. 
      Treasury Department is experimenting with this type of auction to sell the 
      national debt. </P>
      <P>One wonders why any seller would choose this method to auction goods. 
      It seems obvious that a seller would make more money by using a 
      first-price auction, but, in fact, that has been shown to be untrue. 
      Bidders fully understand the rules and modify their bids as circumstances 
      dictate. In the case of a Vickrey auction, bidders adjust upward. No one 
      is deterred out of fear that he will pay too high a price. Aggressive 
      bidders receive sure and certain awards but pay a price closer to market 
      consensus. The price that winning bidder pays is determined by 
      competitors' bids alone and does not depend upon any action the bidder 
      undertakes. Less bid shading occurs because people don't fear <A 
      href="http://www.agorics.com/Library/Auctions/terms.html#winnerc">winner's 
      curse</A>. Bidders are less inclined to compare notes before an auction. 
      </P>
      <P>This type of auction has been used in former Czechoslovakia to 
      refinance credit and in Guinea, Nigeria, and Uganda for foreign exchange. 
      </P>
      <P>What about changing the format just a little and having a second-price, 
      open-outcry auction? In such a case, participants could bid in the 
      ascending format and the winner would ultimately pay the price of the 
      second-highest bid. One might imagine that such an auction would have much 
      the same results as an English (ascending, open-outcry) auction, but, in 
      fact, an auction like that would be easy to manipulate. Imagine bidder A 
      bidding $25 for an item worth $100. Some other bidder could quite easily 
      and safely bid $750, knowing that no one will bid more and that he will 
      only pay $25. Clearly it is imperative to seal the bid. </P>
