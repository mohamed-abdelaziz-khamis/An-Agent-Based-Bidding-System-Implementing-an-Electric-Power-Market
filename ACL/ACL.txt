5-A web site


1)Agents Communication Languages (ACL):
   It is a very important web page about the main 2 types of  ACL's : FIPA-ACL , KQML          
 The table of contents:
      *Introduction to ACL.
      *Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML)
      *Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) ACL
      *Comparing the two ACLs
       (and others)

2)Comparing ACL's:
   It is an important web page about comparing agent communication languages:
   KQML  and FIPA-ACL


3)"Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML)" web page:
    It is an important page about the (KQML) ACL language:
       *Layers Of KQML
       *Performatives Of KQML

4)FIPA ACL Message Structure Specification:
    It is the main page conerning the FIPA-ACL from the FIPA site:
    summary:A description of the structure of FIPA ACL

5)FIPA ACL Tools API Package:
    It is the programming package "nzdis.lang.fipaacl.tool " concerning the FIPA-ACL: 
    
   The class Summary: 

   DisplayTree                                   :GUI-based display of AST
   DisplayTree.TreeFrame   
   DisplayTree.TreeInternalFrame   
   PrintTree                                       :Prints the tree of the given AST on standard output. 
   PrintWalker                                  :Simple AST walker. 
   TreeBuilder                                  :Generic parser utility API, Node builder. 

6)Interface AgentCommunityAdapter:
   
   It is the interface:  AgentCommunityAdapter
   
  public interface AgentCommunityAdapter
 // Defines the interface for interacting with an agent community such as CoABS or FIPA-OS.

  All Known Implementing Classes: 
      CoAbsCommunityAdapter, FipaOsCommunityAdapter 

  e.g.
   In order to send a message:
      public void sendMessage(fipaos.ont.fipa.ACL acl)
                 throws java.io.IOExceptionSends an Agent Communication Language message. 
  Parameters: 
      acl - the Agent Communication Language message to be sent

  (It is a very important web page conerning the FIPA-ACL programming)


7) Comparison of JiVE with Exisiting Multi-System Design Tools: 
   It is an wonderfull page that compare between the different MAS design tools
   (including our JADE tool) according to different  factors 
  (including the ACL Support: F--> FIPA-ACL  ,  K--> KQML)

  "As it is obivious from the table, JADE supports the FIPA-ACL only."

8)jfipa - Java-support for the FIPA Agent Communication Language:

What is jfipa?

  jfipa is a set of java-based tools that supports parsing and routing of envelopes/messages 
of   the FIPA Agent Communication Language (ACL) encoded as XML. 

note: I had sent previously its link to download it. 

9)IEEE ACL:
 This is the web page of the IEEE concerning the ACL 
 we can download the ACL tool from this site from the "Buy Article" link.
 (Ahmed Ragab do that as you are a member in IEEE)

11)The current landscape of Agent Communication Languages(pdf)

Introducing some of the basic concepts relating to Agent Communication Languages, 
Covering KQML and FIPA ACL, the two existing fully-specified ACLs,  
givea brief introduction to their semantics and the issues relating to semantic descriptions of ACLs, 
then shift the focus beyond the semantics and point to problems and limitations shared by both ACLs. 
(and other things)


 Note:
The first attempt to come to a standardised agent communication language (ACL) came forth from 
the DARPA knowledge sharing project and produced the KQML. 
Up till now KQML is the only ACL that is implemented and (widely) used (at least in the academic world).  

jackal is a Java implementation of the KQML
