The (FIPA and MAS folder) contains the following:

1)An Internet-Wide Distributed Security Protocol and Implementation  (very important)

It displays the difference between using the FIPA-ACL in the system (Proposed system) 
and the currently used system (Current system): 

Current system: 
Each agent is responsible for a set of computers. 
The log files produced by the computers are first analyzed by a log file analyzer. 
Any detected problems become goals for the agent to act on. 

Proposed system:
The interaction between the agents will be governed by the FIPA interaction protocols. 

2)Evaluating the FIPA Standards and Its Role in Achieving Cooperation in the MAS
   (very important)
MAS: Multi Agent Systems=Agentcities
*Displays the FIPA role in achieving the cooperation in the MAS
note:
 There exist 4 MAS applications 2 of them using the FIPA protocol that achieves the cooperation in the MAS: 
so it is important to know how FIPA achieves the cooperation in the MAS:

Bidding Agents:  
Network management: 
Teleteaching project: using FIPA protocol
Hotel Service Broker: using FIPA protocol
  
3) FIPA protocol applications:
a-Agentcities Travel Assistant: A multi-agents system that delivers itinerary timetables
*it is a MAS that delivers the time tables of the travel paths of the travellers , 
 An "Agentcities"  travel assistant.

b-Multiagent Network Security System using FIPA-OS
*it is a MAS system using FIPA-OS used for the network security 

4)FIPA navigation service:
a-FIPA Nomadic Application Support Monitor Agent Specification
b-FIPA Nomadic Application Support Overview Specification

*They are important tutorials about how  FIPA supports the navigation (nomadic) service.  
i.e. supporting the wireless services and devices 


5)A FIPA Compliant Query Mechanism Using DAML Query Language (DQL)
*Representing the FIPA Queries by using the DQL language.
