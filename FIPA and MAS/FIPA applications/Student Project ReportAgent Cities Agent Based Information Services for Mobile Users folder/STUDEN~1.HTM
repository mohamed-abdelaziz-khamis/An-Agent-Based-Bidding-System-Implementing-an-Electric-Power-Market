<H2>Description</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Telecommunication and Internet markets are moving rapidly to offer 
  new mobile opportunities. An ever-growing number of services and information 
  sources are now available, but we are realizing the limitations of traditional 
  user interfaces, especially on mobile devices constrained in size and 
  processing power. 
  <P>We think that the <I>agent</I> abstraction can be a powerful paradigm for 
  addressing these issues. It decomposes the complexity of problems into small 
  autonomous communicating entities, the agents, well suited for computationally 
  constrained environments. 
  <P>AgentCities is a promising initiative, which tries to realise the 
  commercial and research potential of FIPA agent applications. It aims to build 
  a network of publicly accessible, continually available FIPA platforms, where 
  each platform represents a real world city or place (Lausanne, Paris, etc). 
  Services deployed in AgentCities centre on information and transaction 
  services for real world objects such as shops, restaurants, hotels, cinemas, 
  theatres etc. 
  <P>In this semester project, we have modelled and implemented hotel services 
  for the city of Lausanne. Our agent system provides <I>information</I> and 
  <I>transaction</I> services: an agent accessing our services can search for 
  hotels satisfying some given conditions, retrieve information about them, and 
  finally book them. The search service is handled by a particular kind of 
  agent, the Hotel Service Broker (HSB). With this agent, it is also possible to 
  book multiple hotels at once. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Results</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The hotel services have been developed and will soon be available 
  on a continuously running FIPA agent platform available at LIA. Services 
  deployed in the testbed are only taking into account ten hotels of Lausanne.

<H2>Future Work</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI>To have the HSB offer even more valuable services: the HSB could be 
    improved in the way it book rooms (for example: cost reduction). 
    <LI>We have to carry out interoperability tests with other platforms. 
    <LI>All hotels of Lausanne should be represented in our environment.
